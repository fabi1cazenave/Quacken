# Firmware

## Keyberon

This directory contains our Keyberon driver. It’s been tested with a SparkFun
Pro Micro RP2040 and should be easy to adapt to other controllers.

To flash your keyboard, get in UF2 bootloader mode and do:

```rust
cargo run
```

If `elf2uf2-rs` does not work “as is” (see [this issue][1]), you can install a
patched version with:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/StripedMonkey/elf2uf2-rs.git#c1638b9
```

## ZMK

[There is a ZMK Configuration on a dedicated repo][2].
It will be moved here when [this PR][3] gets merged.
