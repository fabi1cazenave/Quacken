# Quacken

Libre, ergonomic, *polymorphic*: a single PCB for many possible layouts
— 3×6, 3×5, hummingbird, and everything in between.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Quacken Zero**: unibody
  - [x] first batch with a ProMicro slot, to validate the geometry and design choices
  - [ ] next batches with an onboard nRF52840 (Bluetooth)

- [ ] **Quacken Split**: unibody by default, splittable by choice
  - [ ] onboard RP2040 (left) and I/O expander (right)
  - [ ] splittable in two (I³C communication over a TRRS cable)
  - [ ] splittable outer columns
  - [ ] hotswap sockets
  - [ ] optional Circle Trackpad
  - [ ] optional rotary encoders

- [ ] **Marie-Quackenette*: split and wireless variant of the Quacken Split.
